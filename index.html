                    <p>I started my professional journey in business development and moved over to inside sales shortly thereafter. Across these two roles and five years, I've been responsible for demand generation in our customer base and partner reseller community.  I've had the opportunity to shoulder marketing and sales responsibilities as part of these roles, partnering in various capacities with different functional teams. In being exposed to these different elements of business, I found myself drawn to the marketing and personal alignment with its ethos: the creativity, strategic planning, orchestration of ideas to reality and agile problem solving are all captivating. I've built up the following core competencies and have assembled a portfolio of projects to illustrate my efforts and capabilities within each area. My goal is continued growth in experience and to take on more responsibility, so I can help create and shape projects of increasing scale and complexity.</p>

                <h3>Creative Demand Generation</h3>
                <p>Strengths here include planning and running demand generation campaigns that engage our prospective customers. Working with our product teams and industry experts, I pick out the subject matter and audience for the campaign. To better isolate our target demographic, I identify filters for a number of selective attributes. A collection of tools (e.g. ChatGPT and ZoomInfo) are used to effectively run these filters against the total pool of available accounts and produce our campaign targets. Concurrently, I meet with sales enablement and marketing to plan the cadence duration and steps, KPIs and pivot points. The collateral for each step is built by me, including but not limited to: copywriting, invite forms, webpages, and visual media. With everything in place, I'm tasked with running the campaign from start to finish. We track KPIs for engagement/outcomes, practice A/B testing for material and use this data to pivot at pre-determined points to increase the engagement rate over the lifespan of the campaign.</p>

                <h3>Marketing Project Management</h3>
                <p>I'm capable of structuring and managing customer facing events. Thanks to my CAPM certification from PMI, I'm able to fulfill these responsibilities efficiently and effectively. My experience includes the creation of project scope statements and WBS documents from analysis of historical project data and stakeholder interviews. I'm able to balance the simultaneous tasks of cost and scope planning, and set ambitious but achievable timelines from their constraints. During cost and procurement planning, I: coordinate with vendors, site management, budgetary oversight teams, channel distribution and value-added resellers to gain approvals, and establish cost constraints and flow of funds to vendors. During planning, I also work with stakeholders to outline design elements of the invite campaign. I entrust each team member with their assigned work packages during project execution and lead regular meetings to ensure quality and compliance with the cost/scope/timeline set during planning. When needed, we engage in fast-tracking or crashing schedule compression to manage risk without affecting timeline or scope. On the day of the event, I MC and leverage the established script and improvisational skills to ensure the event runs smoothly.</p>

                <h3>Sales Brand Training</h3>
                <p>You can't get a seller to sell, even with the best training and marketing material, if they don't see the value in it for themselves. If you can learn to speak their language, and align a product with their perspective and beliefs, you can mobilize them effectively. Over the past five years, I've become very capable in this value translation. As part of my current role, I'm tasked with helping and convincing external sellers to push product to their customers. These external sales teams vary greatly, between OEMs and Value-Added Resellers, but the process remains consistent. Through collaboration with channel management and sales leadership, I learn the sales teams' compensation structures and incentives. I learn their sources of revenue from industry, geography, and product perspectives. With industry experts, I discuss existing or looming challenges facing the sellers and their customers- and extrapolate implications for revenue and account retention. With the product team, I construct a framing using this information to position our product as a strategic tool. We create resonance with the sellers' desire to protect their revenue streams and ambition to become further embedded in their accounts. I present this to the sellers to secure engagement first, then follow up with sales training for the product set and coaching on effective positioning.</p>
