                    <p>I started my professional journey in business development and moved over to inside sales shortly thereafter. Across these two roles and five years, I've been responsible for demand generation in our customer base and partner reseller community.  I've had the opportunity to shoulder marketing and sales responsibilities as part of these roles, partnering in various capacities with different functional teams. In being exposed to these different elements of business, I found myself drawn to the marketing and personal alignment with its ethos: the creativity, strategic planning, orchestration of ideas to reality and agile problem solving are all captivating. I've built up the following core competencies and have assembled a portfolio of projects to illustrate my efforts and capabilities within each area. My goal is continued growth in experience and to take on more responsibility, so I can help create and shape projects of increasing scale and complexity.</p>

                <h3>Creative Demand Generation</h3>
                <p>Strengths here include planning and running demand generation campaigns that engage our prospective customers. Working with our product teams and industry experts, I pick out the subject matter and audience for the campaign. To better isolate our target demographic, I identify filters for a number of selective attributes. A collection of tools (e.g. ChatGPT and ZoomInfo) are used to effectively run these filters against the total pool of available accounts and produce our campaign targets. Concurrently, I meet with sales enablement and marketing to plan the cadence duration and steps, KPIs and pivot points. The collateral for each step is built by me, including but not limited to: copywriting, invite forms, webpages, and visual media. With everything in place, I'm tasked with running the campaign from start to finish. We track KPIs for engagement/outcomes, practice A/B testing for material and use this data to pivot at pre-determined points to increase the engagement rate over the lifespan of the campaign.</p>
